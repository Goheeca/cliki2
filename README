CLiki2 is the Common Lisp wiki web application behind
http://www.cliki.net

CLiki2 and all the CLiki2 dependencies are available via
Quicklisp. The fastest way to install CLiki2 is to:
(ql:quickload :cliki2)

CLiki2 expects to use /var/cliki2/ as a data directory to store wiki
contents and logs. This can be modified by editing the file
src/start.lisp. The Common Lisp HyperSpec (for symbol links in wiki
pages) needs to be in the folder HyperSpec/ under the data directory,
and the symbol table at HyperSpec/Data/Symbol-Table.text (customizable
in src/start.lisp).

By default, CLiki2 starts a web server on port 8080. To specify the
port, put the port number as the first line in the file named "port"
in the data directory.
