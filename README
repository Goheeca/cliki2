CLiki2 is the Common Lisp wiki behind http://www.cliki.net

All CLiki2 dependencies are available via Quicklisp. The fastest way
to install CLiki2 is to: (ql:quickload :cliki2)

CLiki2 stores its data and reads configuration files from the
directory specified by the environment variable CLIKI_HOME. This
variable needs to be set before loading CLiki2.

CLiki2 expects 3 config files in the CLIKI_HOME directory:
config/port - web server port (ex: 80 on the first line)
config/name - wiki name (ex: "CLiki" on the first line)
config/description - wiki description (ex: "the common lisp wiki" on the
                     first line)
config/reminder-email - from email address (ex: "noreply@cliki.net")
                        for sending out password reminders

CLiki2 stylesheets and background images need to be in
CLIKI_HOME/static. Example styles are available from
http://github.com/vsedach/cliki2-style and
http://github.com/vsedach/alu-wiki-style

The Common Lisp HyperSpec (for symbol links in wiki pages) needs to be
in the folder HyperSpec/ in CLIKI_HOME, and the symbol table at
HyperSpec/Data/Symbol-Table.text.

To start CLiki2 two functions are provided: start-cliki-server and
load-cliki-store. The starting steps are split up into two to assist
in daemonizing the CLiki2 server (see start-daemon.lisp for an
example).

For SBCL running on Unix only, the :cliki-daemon system is provided to
conveniently daemonize a CLiki2 process. It depends on cl-daemonize
(https://github.com/mishoo/cl-daemonize), runs SWANK on port 4010, and
expects to setuid/gid to user and group named cliki2.
