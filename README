CLiki2 is the Common Lisp wiki behind http://www.cliki.net

All CLiki2 dependencies are available via Quicklisp. The fastest way
to install CLiki2 is to: (ql:quickload :cliki2)

To start CLiki2 two functions are provided: start-cliki-server and
load-cliki-store. The starting steps are split up into two to assist
in daemonizing the CLiki2 server (see start-daemon.lisp for an
example).

Example use of the start functions:

(start-cliki-server
  :port 8081
  :wiki-home #P"/home/alu-wiki/"
  :wiki-name "ALU"
  :wiki-description "Association of Lisp Users"
  :password-reminder-email-address "noreply@wiki.alu.org")

(load-cliki-store "/home/alu-wiki/")

CLiki2 stylesheets and background images need to be in
wiki-home/static. Example styles are available from
http://github.com/vsedach/cliki2-style and
http://github.com/vsedach/alu-wiki-style

The Common Lisp HyperSpec (for symbol links in wiki pages) needs to be
in the folder HyperSpec/ in wiki-home, and the symbol table at
HyperSpec/Data/Symbol-Table.text.

For SBCL running on Unix only, the :cliki-daemon system is provided to
conveniently daemonize a CLiki2 process. It depends on cl-daemonize
(https://github.com/mishoo/cl-daemonize).
